# menumenu-parser
A python parser developed for myself, parsing the slovak [menumenu.sk](https://menumenu.sk) website. Working on the weekly menu pdfs for one of the restuarants listed there, I made this script whose output is parsed by Affinity Publisher to automatically insert the text.
This cut down the weekly processing time from 30-40 minutes down to between 5 and 10.

## Potential downside:  
If the site owners at menumenu decide to change any of the html elements, the script breaks. The script was created and tested 28 - November - 2021.  
Still works great October - 2024

## Potential upgrades:
Script works just as expected, automating a boring manual process. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## Time spent:
Roughly 10 hours to create the script, create the Affinity templates, work with Data Merge within Affinity Publisher and putting it all together.
